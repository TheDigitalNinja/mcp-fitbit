# MCP Fitbit Server - Remaining Tasks

This document outlines the remaining improvement opportunities for the MCP Fitbit server after major refactoring work has been completed.

## Project Status

**✅ MAJOR REFACTORING COMPLETED**

The following high-impact tasks have been successfully completed:
- ✅ **Inconsistent API Request Handling** - Consolidated to shared utilities
- ✅ **Incomplete Token Management** - Auto-refresh and expiry checking implemented
- ✅ **Type Safety Issues** - Added proper TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ **Code Duplication & Patterns** - Created reusable tool registration helpers
- ✅ **Constants Management** - Centralized all constants in `src/config.ts`
- ✅ **Missing Development Tools** - Added ESLint, Prettier, and Vitest

## Remaining Tasks (Minimal, Focused Improvements)

### 1. **Environment Validation** 
**Priority: Medium | Effort: Low | Status: RECOMMENDED**

**Problem:** No validation that required environment variables exist before server starts.

**Why needed:** Improves user experience with clear error messages when setup is incomplete.

**Solution:**
- Add startup validation for `FITBIT_CLIENT_ID` and `FITBIT_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Provide clear error messages for missing environment variables
- Fail fast with helpful guidance

**Files to modify:**
- `src/index.ts` - Add environment validation before server setup

### 2. **Minor Type Safety Cleanup**
**Priority: Low | Effort: Low | Status: OPTIONAL**

**Problem:** 4 ESLint warnings about remaining `any` types in `auth.ts` and `utils.ts`.

**Why needed:** Complete the type safety work for consistency.

**Solution:**
- Replace remaining `any` types with proper interfaces
- Should be straightforward given existing patterns

**Files to modify:**
- `src/auth.ts` - Fix 3 `any` type warnings  
- `src/utils.ts` - Fix 1 `any` type warning

## Tasks Removed (Over-engineering for Local Tool)

### ~~Rate Limiting Protection~~ **REMOVED**
**Reason:** This is a local development tool, not a production service. Rate limiting adds unnecessary complexity for minimal benefit.

### ~~Token Storage Security~~ **REMOVED** 
**Reason:** Plain text storage is acceptable for local development. The token file is local-only and adding encryption adds complexity without meaningful security benefit.

### ~~Advanced Logging Strategy~~ **REMOVED**
**Reason:** `console.error` is perfectly adequate for a local development tool. Structured logging is overkill.

### ~~Interface Abstraction~~ **REMOVED**
**Reason:** Current abstractions in `utils.ts` are sufficient. Further abstraction risks over-engineering a simple tool.

### ~~Build Configuration Enhancement~~ **REMOVED**
**Reason:** Current TypeScript configuration works well. Optimization would provide minimal benefit.

### ~~Error Handling Standardization~~ **REMOVED**
**Reason:** Current error handling via shared utilities is adequate. Further standardization is unnecessary complexity.

## Implementation Recommendation

**Recommended Action:** Complete **Environment Validation** (#1) only.

**Optional:** Fix the minor type safety warnings if you want 100% clean linting.

## Design Philosophy Reminder

This MCP server is designed to be:
- **Simple and focused** - 1:1 proxy to Fitbit API
- **Local development tool** - Not a production service
- **Minimal complexity** - Easy to understand and maintain

The major refactoring work has already addressed all critical issues. The remaining tasks are minor quality-of-life improvements that should only be pursued if there's clear value.

## Contributing

When working on remaining tasks:
1. Maintain the project's simplicity
2. Avoid over-engineering solutions
3. Test with the MCP inspector
4. Update this document when completed
